# What-is-NumPy-
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a foundational package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Key Features of NumPy:
High-performance N-dimensional array object: NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python lists for large datasets. They consume less memory and offer faster processing.

Broadcasting functionality: This allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.

Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code: Useful for when you need to integrate your Python code with legacy code or highly optimized libraries.

Linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities: Essential tools for scientific computing.

Can be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data: Arbitrary data-types can be defined which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

Basic NumPy Example
Let's go through a simple example to demonstrate basic NumPy functionality. We'll:

Import NumPy.
Create a NumPy array.
Perform some basic operations (like addition, multiplication).
Show how slicing works in NumPy arrays.
I'll write and execute the Python code for this example.

Here's the breakdown of the example we just ran with NumPy:

Creating a NumPy Array:

We created an array array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). This is a simple one-dimensional array.
Basic Operations:

Addition: array_plus_10 = array + 10 resulted in adding 10 to each element of the array. So, our original array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] became [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
Multiplication: array_times_2 = array * 2 resulted in each element being multiplied by 2. The original array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] transformed to [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
Slicing:

We sliced the array using array_slice = array[1:4]. This means we took elements from index 1 up to, but not including, index 4. So, from our original array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we got [2, 3, 4].
This example demonstrates the ease of handling arrays with NumPy and performing operations on them. The real power of NumPy becomes evident with larger datasets and more complex operations, particularly in scientific and numerical computing contexts. â€‹

Certainly! Let's look at a more comprehensive example using NumPy. In this example, we'll:

1. **Create a two-dimensional array (matrix).**
2. **Perform some matrix operations** like transposition and matrix multiplication.
3. **Calculate some statistics** like mean, median, and standard deviation.

### Example: Matrix Operations and Statistics with NumPy

#### Objective:
We'll create a 3x3 matrix and perform various operations to demonstrate the versatility of NumPy in handling arrays and performing calculations.

Let's get started with the code.

Here's what we did in this NumPy example:

1. **Created a 3x3 Matrix**:
   - The matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` is a basic 3x3 matrix.

2. **Matrix Transposition**:
   - We transposed the matrix using `matrix.T`, resulting in `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`. Transposing swaps the rows and columns.

3. **Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product)**:
   - We calculated the dot product of the matrix with its transpose using `np.dot(matrix, transposed_matrix)`. This results in a new 3x3 matrix where each element is the dot product of rows and columns from the original and transposed matrices.

4. **Calculating Statistics**:
   - **Mean**: The mean (average) of all the elements in the matrix was calculated as `5.0`.
   - **Median**: The median value among all the elements in the matrix was also `5.0`.
   - **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values, was calculated as approximately `2.58`.

This example demonstrates how NumPy can be used for matrix operations and statistical calculations, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and scientific computing.
